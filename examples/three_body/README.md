# ðŸŒŒ Three-Body Problem Simulation

Welcome to an advanced celestial mechanics simulation demonstrating stable solutions to the famous **three-body problem**! This example showcases the Haggis framework's capability for complex multi-body physics simulations.

## ðŸ“– What is the Three-Body Problem?

The three-body problem is one of the most famous problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics:

> **Given three celestial bodies with known masses, positions, and velocities, predict their future motion under mutual gravitational attraction.**

While the two-body problem has a closed-form analytical solution, the three-body problem generally does not. Most three-body systems exhibit **chaotic behavior**, making long-term prediction impossible. However, certain special configurations produce stable, periodic orbits.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll See

This simulation demonstrates three different stable orbital configurations:

### ðŸŒŸ Figure-8 Orbit (Default)
- **Discovery**: Found by Carles SimÃ³ in 2000 using numerical methods
- **Configuration**: Three equal masses (m=1.0 each) following a figure-eight shaped path
- **Initial Conditions**: Uses exact researched values for guaranteed stability
- **Stability**: Perfectly periodic with a period of ~6.32 time units
- **Beauty**: One of the most elegant solutions to the three-body problem
- **Implementation**: Runge-Kutta 4th order integration with timestep dt=0.005

### ðŸ”º Triangular (Lagrange) Configuration  
- **Discovery**: Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1772) - theoretical solution
- **Configuration**: Three bodies at the vertices of an equilateral triangle
- **Stability**: Stable for certain mass ratios (demonstrated with equal masses)
- **Real Examples**: Jupiter's Trojan asteroids occupy similar L4/L5 points

### ðŸŒŒ Hierarchical System
- **Configuration**: Close binary pair + distant third body  
- **Stability**: Stable when third body is sufficiently distant
- **Real Examples**: Alpha Centauri system, many exoplanet systems
- **Dynamics**: Third body orbits the center of mass of the binary pair

## ðŸ”¬ Physics Implementation

### Gravitational Forces
The simulation implements **Newton's law of universal gravitation**:

```
F = G * (m1 * m2) / rÂ²
```

Where:
- `F` = gravitational force between two bodies
- `G` = gravitational constant (scaled for simulation)
- `m1, m2` = masses of the two bodies  
- `r` = distance between the centers of mass

### Numerical Integration
We use **Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4)** integration for high accuracy:

1. **Why RK4?** Higher-order methods provide better energy conservation
2. **Timestep Control**: Adaptive timesteps ensure numerical stability
3. **Conservation Laws**: The simulation preserves energy and momentum within numerical precision

### Initial Conditions
Each configuration uses carefully researched initial conditions:

- **Figure-8**: Exact values from SimÃ³'s 2000 discovery
  - Body 1: pos(0.9700436, -0.24308753, 0), vel(0.466203685, 0.43236573, 0)
  - Body 2: pos(-0.9700436, 0.24308753, 0), vel(0.466203685, 0.43236573, 0)  
  - Body 3: pos(0, 0, 0), vel(-0.932407370, -0.86473146, 0)
- **Triangular**: Calculated from Lagrange point theory
- **Hierarchical**: Derived from hierarchical triple star systems

## ðŸŽ® Controls and Features
